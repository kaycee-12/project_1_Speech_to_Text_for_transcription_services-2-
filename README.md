# 🗣️ Speech-to-Text for Transcription Services

This project implements an automated **speech-to-text transcription system** that converts spoken audio into written text using modern speech recognition technologies.

## 📌 Overview

The goal of this project is to build an efficient and scalable pipeline for transcribing speech into text. This can be applied to various industries including media, education, healthcare, and customer support.

## 🚀 Features

* Converts audio (WAV/MP3) into text
* Supports **multiple languages** (based on model/dataset used)
* Real-time or batch processing modes
* Visualization of audio waveforms and spectrograms
* Basic preprocessing (noise reduction, resampling)
* Text cleanup and formatting

## 🧰 Technologies Used

* `Python`
* `SpeechRecognition`
* `pydub`
* `wave`
* `librosa` (for audio feature visualization)
* `matplotlib` (for plotting)
* `transformers` and `whisper` (optional, if used)

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Audio File Input**
   Load audio in common formats like `.wav` or `.mp3`.

2. **Preprocessing**
   Normalize volume, reduce noise, and ensure consistent sampling rate.

3. **Speech Recognition**
   Use Python's `speech_recognition` library (or optionally, models like `OpenAI Whisper`) to convert speech to text.

4. **Post-Processing**
   Clean up transcribed text, handle punctuation, remove filler words.

5. **Output**
   Display and optionally save the transcribed text to a file.

## 🧪 Sample Usage

```python
import speech_recognition as sr

recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
audio_file = sr.AudioFile('sample.wav')

with audio_file as source:
    audio_data = recognizer.record(source)
    text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio_data)
    print(text)
```

## ✅ Requirements

* Python ≥ 3.7
* Required libraries:

  ```bash
  pip install speechrecognition pydub librosa matplotlib
  ```

> Note: `ffmpeg` is required for handling MP3 files using `pydub`.

## 🌍 Multilingual Support

If enhanced with models like **Whisper** or **transformers-based ASR**, the project can transcribe audio in various languages.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

* Add punctuation and sentence segmentation
* Integrate Whisper for multilingual & robust transcription
* Add diarization (speaker identification)
* Deploy via web interface using Flask or Streamlit
